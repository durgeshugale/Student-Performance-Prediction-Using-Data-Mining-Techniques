# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Data-Mining-Techniques

The success of an academic institution can be
measured in terms of quality of education provides to its
students. In the education system, highest level of quality
is achieved by exploring the data relating to redirection
about students performance. These days the lack of
existing system to analyse and judge the students
performance and progress isn't being addressed. There
are 2 reasons why this is often happening. First, the
present system is not accurate to predict students‟
performance. Second, because of shortage of
consideration of some vital factor those are affecting
students‟ performance. Predicting students‟ performance
is more challenging task as a result of large amount of
information in academic database. This proposed system
can help to predict students‟ performance more
accurately. For these suitable data mining approach will
be applied. In this approach, preprocessing step will be
applied to raw dataset so that the mining algorithm will
be applied properly. The prediction about students‟
performance can help him/her to enhance the
performance.

The aim of this project is to improve the current
trends in the higher education systems and to find out
which factors might help in creating successful
students. It is really necessary to find successful
students as it motivates higher education systems to
know them well and one way to know this is by using
valid management and processing of the student’s
database.

We have implemented our algorithms with the help of
Python. We have made use of in-built python libraries
and packages to implement our classification
algorithms We have made use of the following libraries
and packages:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
5. Flask 

# Data Description
1. Data source
link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance
2. Data format: Integer
3. Size: 396 rows X 33 columns
4. Number of Instances: 396
5. Number of Attributes: 33 

# Steps To Follow
1. Install all Python Liabraries
2. Execute "python app.py" on Command Prompt 
3. Copy and Paste "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" on your Browser(Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge)
4. Fill all details and predict the performance

# Environment
We run the experiments on the 4 GB RAM PC, with
1.90GHz of Intel i5 Processor. In evaluating this
models, we used python Programming. We split the
data into two parts, train data set containing 70% of
the data and test data set containing the remaining
30%
